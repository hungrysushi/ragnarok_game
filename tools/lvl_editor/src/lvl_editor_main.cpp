    1. World renderer for background, obstacles
    2. Render text/thought bubbles upon interaction with environment
    3. sprite sheet parser/selector based off of input from user

/* NOTE: for the level editor, the initial methods to be worked on are:
    1. creating object with total dimensions that can vary (i.e: spawn level with total x and y coordinates)
    2. returning location in the world
    3. adding in entities that are previously defined
    4. parsing layout in pre-determined manner for grid layout  
    5. returning grid block size
    6. vector resolution and aspect ratios to tell renderer to render with different sizes
*/
// NOTE: files in the obstacles directory will include generic geometric shapes that can be added in to world layout
// NOTE: files in npc directory will include attributes to different npc that are called when needed
