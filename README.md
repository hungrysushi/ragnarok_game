# Game Project

Runs on Unreal Engine

The readme will be updated with miscellaenous details as the project progresses.

High level design decisions can also be documented here.

### Storyline Discussion
- Depicting and detailing the Norse apocalypse, Ragnarok
- An elderly nomadic scribe known by the name of Ragnarok whose purpose is to detail the events of Ragnarok by extracting experiences from Norse gods such as Odin, Thor, Baldr, etc.
- The scribe meets each god, and forcefully (sometimes not) extracts their experiences and replays their story while gaining their abilities to be used throughout gameplay, adding on to his story which will eventually be compiled into the Poetic Edda, the main source of Norse mythological studies in modern day
- List of gods to be in-game TBD, the main roster includes Odin, Thor, Loki, Baldr, Tyr, Frej/Freja
- List of enemies includes Surtur, Jormungundr, Fenris, Hel, the frost giants
- Worlds to be considered are the nine realms, including Asgard, Midgard (humans), Jotunheim (frost giants), Muspelheim (Surtur), amongst others
- Ragnarok (as each god) would fight each enemy, then meet their doom. After each fight, Ragnarok would extract the remaining details from that god, and close that "chapter" of his book. Tying into the Poetic Edda, like a fitting closing line, might be a nice ode to the tale. Thinking of an Assassin's Creed-esque end to each main enemies portion of the story, just an idea.
- Possible starting point: Ragnarok is this eternal being, and so is able to detail the events of the beginning of the world, as well as the end. Starting in Ginnungagap, the void that existed before the world's creation, the beginning of the story unfolds, and Ragnarok could meet Odin at first to get more information about how everything unfolded. This won't be Odin's end, he could return later in the story to fill in the last cracks of Ragnarok's tale. This will allow for ambiguity and story progression.
- Different "mythical" items can be scattered around the world, which would give the player some sort of lasting perk (Only example i can think of: Darksiders weapons, game can progress without Death's scythe but it gives the player a new weapon and new abilities that are add-ons)

### Gameplay Discussion
- The main feature of the game is the storyline, trying to entice the player to move forward to unveil more parts of the story. There is a lot of material that can be added on to the main story line, in order to not make the game extremely linear, but still driven towards an end-goal.
- Instead of forcing the player to follow a certain order of gods, they can choose to start with a certain list of gods, like a tiered style, while still interweaving stories (i.e: jump out of Thor's story, then run into Loki), possibly a way to weave in Ragnarok's thoughts into the gameplay while allowing the player to piece together the story on their own. Would have to set "waypoints" in the levels that would allow for a safe transition back to the central level (storyline example: speaking to different NPCs, would have to speak to an NPC that is a sorcerer to teleport them back to another realm)
- The gameplay was initially set to be a 2D side-scoller, with 16-bit pixel artwork and audio, aimed at being a retro style game
- Physics would play a part in the overall gameplay, i.e: icy ground would cause a character to slip around instead of standing still, sand would cause slower movement
- Up for discussion: basic AI component for boss battles, bosses learn patterns of movement and acts accordingly

### Player Attributes
- Add in dialog for various NPCs, dialogue would be relevant to race, gender, age, i.e: speaking to a female human child would result in different dialogue than a male elven elder.
- Interaction with surroundings such as breaking pots/crates to find in-game gold or items (possibly?)
- Different items can weild different attributes, such as armor, health, damage, new spells
- Player abilities: Hero attributes can include a list of spells that can be used from hotkeys, a backpack of items that can be used on the character, stash for items available in multiple places around the world
- Basic level-up scheme would be available, up to a certain maximum. Total health, base armor, base damage, total manapool, new abilities (double jump, etc) might be available, TBD
- Base attributes change between characters? Loki would have a larger manapool than Thor, but less base damage and HP
- Should a characters spells be locked to an individual character, and Ragnarok gain all the spells for himself to be used for when he is in his form? Avoids mixing and matching abilities which don't work on everyone
